```{r set-up, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE,

```

# Getting started

1. Clone your repo `appex06-[github_name]` to create a new project
   in RStudio Cloud under the STA 199 class space.

2. Configure git
      ```{r config-git-ex, eval=FALSE}
      library(usethis)
      use_git_config(user.name="your name", user.email="your email")
      ```

# Packages and Data

We'll make use of the following packages.

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(genius) # https://github.com/JosiahParry/genius
library(wordcloud)
library(reshape2)
```

## Part 1

Choose two albums of your choice, and read in their song lyric data from Genius.
Add a variable for the artist and album, and don't forget to save these data 
frames for later use. 

```{r part-1-reading-data}

```


## Part 2

Tidy up the lyrics by removing commonly used words. Display a table of the most
commonly used words (after cleaning up the stop words). Are these words what
you expect from the albums? Create a visualization of these words for each 
album.

```{r part-2-cleanup-dataviz}

```

## Part 3

Use the `bing` lexicon to get the sentiments for the lyrics for each of your
selected albums. You may need to interactively download this lexicon (I will
demonstrate on the screen; dont forget to change `eval` to be `TRUE` in the
chunk below). Create a visualization comparing positive vs. negative words for 
each album. What comparisons can be made?

```{r part-3-get-lexicon, eval = FALSE}
get_sentiments("bing") 
```

```{r part-3-sentiment-viz}

```

## Part 4

Create a wordcloud for each album.

```{r task-4-wordcloud}

```
